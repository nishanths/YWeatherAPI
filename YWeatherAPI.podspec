  A powerful API wrapper for [Yahoo Weather](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/) for iOS and Mac. Built on top of AFNetworkingâ€™s blocks-based architecture, it fetches responses asynchronously without any waiting on the main thread. It supports:


  * Caching results with customizable expiry times,
  * Requesting forecasts by natural-language location strings, `CLLocation` coordinates, and Yahoo WOEIDs,
  * Customizing default temperature, pressure, speed, and distance return units.
